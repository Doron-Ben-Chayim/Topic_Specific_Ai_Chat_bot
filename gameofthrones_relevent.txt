I loved Tyrion.
As someone who ready the first four books, then stopped, waiting for the series to finish, the main thing you miss if you read the books sadly, is an ending. (So far at least)
No, you get an ending. Even the books' ending, probably. It's just that you get it as if it's a spoiler, as you don't get the full story that leads into it.
I wasn't gonna watch but I may as well since there will be spoilers EVERYWHERE. 
I dont want spoilers but does this have spoilers for the actual season 
You can’t spoil Game of Thrones! 
I guess I should start season one. I read the books but couldn't get into the show, but this is looking good.
why is this not a spoiler... i don't get it
Game of Thrones
Is this a scene from game of thrones ? Only read the books else
How is this a spoiler?
"Spoilers" From 3 seasons ago?
Yes more spoiler please
This post has spoilers
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EPISODE YET: *SPOILDED*.
I mean it's not like the show would do it justice after the way Game of Thrones has devolved after they stopped following the books
Aw man you put arya’s scene instead of tyrion killing shae and tywin... aside from that pretty dope
Edit
Oops its there my bad just saw it its just a bit dark
Game of throney throne thrones!
Finally game of thrones for the busy person.
People are allowed to be disappointed by the ending, when they have invested so much time in watching the show, only to have the final episodes rushed out so the writers can get on with their new project.
You mean things happened after Tyrion killed Tywin?
It's weird that they ended it so soon then put out that mini episode of Cleganebowl. Shame. I'd like to know what is up with the dragon in the background.
Tyrion in shambles
How is this a spoiler
[Spoilers] Here's the spoiler in the fucking title, enjoy.
What a shit ending! It ruined the show completely! Extremely disappointed.
No spoilers? That looks like Jamie sitting on the throne though!
How is this a spoiler?
How is this a spoiler?
How is this a spoiler?
[spoilers] can some kind soul spoil me what happened in the last few episodes?
Where’s Cersei? And Tyrion?
I'm not seeing a ton of Lannisters here (just Jamie).  Possible spoiler?
No spoilers lol. So what the fuck is Jaime doing there?!
Where's Ned Stark. You said no spoilers FUCK
Tyrion is only half into it interesting 🤐🤔
Where are the Dragons?
Where are the dragons?
I would argue that this is a spoiler because of how it shows Jaime, Danny in Winterfell which is a pretty big deal to anyone not caught up completely
*Well, what can we say. Its been a real long and fun 8 years and now we part, not that either of us wants to. This is just more than 'Absolute GOLD'. I'm simply awestruck, which has left me speechless. Game of Thrones has truly been an ineffable series and I'm glad to have gone through it all. So, for the millionth time, Thank you George Martin, David and Daniel, for such incredibly made and enthralling series. Perhaps, no more years of crazy speculations, neither any more of the heart-exploding exuberance or intense hype for what episode/season you guys bring us next. But, this this experience has been peerless.*  

*The Fans Remember.*
After the big reveal to Jon Snow they're not gonna kill him off until he's had a chance to face off with Dany
Is this game of thrones season 8
Now THAT'S Tyrion from the books
I see who really should have played Tyrion.
Tyrion , Hand on the Queen...
only because Stunt Tyrion is just a little off..
Seems a lot of a spoiler to me if you know what I mean
How is this no spoiler?
Next up cersei, killed by the king slayer
It is a game after all.  


Of thrones.
No spoilers huh? I remember when Jon died like in an earlier season
\*NO Spoilers\*... proceeds to read 4 comments now the show is completely ruined for me... FMLL
~~How this isn't spoiler ?
I didn't know that all of them going to last :(~~
I’ve never watched game of thrones
Not a spoiler if you don't know about it
Not a spoiler if you don't know about it
Arya kills Daenerys in the finale. 🤯
Refresh my memory. This happened to Cersei and what other character?
>t and is forced to kill her. Rather than claim his birthright on the Iron Throne he'll ride North, maybe a "my reign is ended" like when he left the Wall. Final scene is an old Jon North of the Wall with Ghost.

Agree. Makes room for Sansa + Tyrion on the Throne.
Daenerys is already a villain change my mind.
Oh yeah I forgot about that, Arya is fine then.
Will you elaborate about Jon and Arya, I haven't read the books.
It’s funny how a character that  fucking died in season 8 ended up having the best ending to wrap there arc up out of all of them
Exactly. The ending to the show was never going to be "bad" because the show in and of itself was so good. But because of that, the show deserved a great ending to match everything it gave us over the past decade, unfortunately for everyone they couldn't deliver.
[no spoilers] ? Really? 

Don’t thinks that’s needed anymore. I even waited until the season was over and torrented it and ive seen it all.
Really had to say no spoilers though?
SPOILER ALERT!!!!   ITS FROM GAME OF THRONES!!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
This just made season 8 worth it.
whoops spoiler tag
title says no spoilers, yet in the comment section, what do we find?
It was spoilers from the last episode in a no-spoiler thread
It was spoilers.
Thank you! I don't really know how to explain it, but I couldn't really enjoy the finale knowing that this is the end and also the ending was full of openings for all the characters, which just put me in a sad mood all afternoon. Reading this gave me a hope, that I know about the fate of the characters.
Would have liked Dany to get a little better of an ending
So what happened to Tyrion?
Game of thrones sucks, 8 season
What happens to tyrion in this epilogue?
Game of Game of Thrones
It's about....the thrones.
*Thrones* of Westeros?
Thrones of Westeros. It’s decided
That's the worst thing with vague spoilers. You can't really get it out of your head while you're watching the episode, so it kind of ruins everything.
I think tywin won't let tyrion get in this picture.
~~[No Spoilers]~~ A lol of spoilers.
Tyrion should be peeking around a pillar or something. Tywin wouldn't have this.
Great but i feel like tywin wouldn't have included Tyrion
I love the subtle spoilers, the glove on Jamie's hand, Cersei's dead daughter on the boat, dead son by the drink foaming at the mouth, another dead son face down suffer committing suicide, Tyrion's bow and arrow.
This is actually full of spoilers. Maybe subtlety and without context but there most definitely are spoilers in this.
Says no spoilers. This is straight spoilers.
I wish Tywin had dumped Tyrion in the river.
Why is this tagged with NO SPOILERS? You've spoiled Daenerys for me forever!
Now this is the true Daenerys 
Now this is Daenerys.
Isn’t this a spoiler due to the color of the one dragon? 
Game of thrones: A series of unfortunate events
Dany character going through worse
“Spoiler for a thing (spoilers before this)” is the absolute worst way to do spoilers
What?!? No spoilers but I see Bran in a wheelchair... The series is ruined for me.
Bran is in a wheelchair??? You said no spoilers!!!!
Sums up the character endings with Jon content with what he got
"no spoilers" while posting a huge spoiler for the book readers lmfao
Watch the throne
The only spoiler here would occur if anyone asked why he has 2 dragons...lol
Nice. You explained why it's a spoiler by spoiling it.
This is actually one of my favorite parts of all of game of thrones
One True King... Stannis : Thanks.
(Looks closely at the photo) You know....I don’t think that is actually Tyrion Lannister...
No spoilers except indicating that Drogon survives, I guess.
Are you upset you saw a spoiler? I will set it straight for you. They actually crown Ghost king of seven kingdoms. Sansa objects, gets bitten, then concedes. Ghost picks Drogon as his hand and Jon as getter of treats. The wheel is broken. They make a new throne out of bones.
"Previously on game of thrones"...
I'll read them when they're finished. The only thing more disappointing than the TV ending would be no ending at all, and honestly that seems like where it's headed
The show is over, whats the point of the [SPOILER/NO-SPOILER] tags now?
Game of Thrones: The Board Game
Game of Thrones is coming 
Foreshadowing that Jon will live through the war but Arya and Sansa will die...?
From the first book: 

>You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You’ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a **needle** still locked tight between your frozen fingers.”  
>  
>Arya didn’t think it was funny.

Yeah i don't think Arya is going to make it.

&#x200B;
How is this a spoiler
Dany is the Fire AND Ice. Just like Jon. But she is dead and he is alive.
How is this spoilers?
how is this a spoiler?
What is the spoiler from this post??
How is this spoilers ?
How is this a spoiler exactly?
How is this a spoiler? This is from season 1 right?
Why is this a spoiler?
How the fuck is this spoilers 
How is this spoilers?
Wait how is this a spoiler?
Thanks so much! I'm doing my best to avoid spoilers for everything so far and I'm pretty sure only like the last season or so isn't in the books yet, but it's already so good, I cannot wait to get caught up.
Game of thrones
[SPOILERS] More like Lord of the Six Kingdoms.
im not sure if this is no spoilers ;)
Game of Thrones: The Last Watch
**You hit the nail on the head!**

I found that I don't really care what happens in Season 8 because no matter how much you try to use what the show gives you to figure things out, they come out of left field and you had no chance to predict that.

It's not a surpise like "oh wow! You got me! That's totally something new that tells me about their character!" but rather "oh, they really wanted this next plot point to happen, so they picked a character at random to drive it."

It feels like a D&D game where no matter what path you take, the DM just tells his story anyway.
Couldn't have said it better myself. At the start of the season i avoided spoilers like the plague, now logic and character development has been shoved out a window all for the sake of shock factor.. i just dont care anymore. Sad to see this is how the show goes out, fingers crossed for the final 2 eps.. right guys..
Dany watching everyone love on Jon and feeing inferior is the exact same thing that happened between her and her brother, causing him to unravel in season 1. Except now Dany is the one outside looking in.
Why say no spoilers? What could be spoiled? All available episodes have been out for like a year....
Oh but this IS spoilers...
This should be spoiler since this is actually how the show is going to end
I hope so much this actually happens, Daenerys on the throne would be sooo disappointing
Plot twist: this *is* a spoiler.
OP said no spoilers, but maybe this is a spoiler after all!
*Spoilers*


1. The Mountain gouging out Oberyn’s eyes 
2. Lord Varys and his “little birds”
3. John Snow playing with Ghost his DireWolf. (What is in his hand?)
4. Brienne dancing with  Jaime Lannister (She luuuh him) 
5. Cersei drunk on wine dancing with a wanted sign of her brother Tyrion (She haaaate him)
6. The Hound adorably(?) manhandling Arya
7.  The Night King being fabulous
8. Tyrion being an adorable(?) drunken lecher
9. Bran bribing Hodor(?)
10. Dany being the badass Mother of Dragons. Duh.

Hope this helped. 
Bit confusing why the Lannister kids aren't in it. I mean Tywin is. 
I for one wanted a finale where Dany retreats/survives to Essos and Drogon gets sick and is like dying and she's sad but then, surprise, Drogon is a female and she's laid 30 eggs. \*Thrones theme blares from the bloody horizon.\*

edit: i've subsequently learned dragons, according to Maester Barth's text "*Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History"* are asexual and reproduce at will so...it lays eggs?
I'm on episode 3 and cos you put no spoilers now I know that Daenerys has 3 dragons. Thanks a lot !
That or maybe Tyrion. Info being passed down from Bran
welcome to game of thrones where the writing doesn't matter and plots are made up! For seven seasons they have built up Jon and Bran's story AROUND THE OTHERS and they toss it out the window for a cheap "badass" moment.
How did Arya get there?
You know, as someone who never watched game of thrones, this is hilarious
As someone who hasn’t read the books but considering buying them, how does the experience of reading the first three books compare to watching the show?
I read the books before I watched the show. While I enjoy seeing the story visually, the books are better because you get more character insight.
is it bad if i think if the last couple episodes are as underwhelming as the basically the entire later end of the series when they ran out of source material i might have to bump it down from great to good?  


watching the writers kind of undo all the character development and all the intriguing plots and characters just kind of fall flat has been pretty brutal honestly, all my excitement for the wait of this final season is kinda having the wind taken out of the saild, night king just kinda going out with a whimper, awfully bad battle strategy, battle of the bastards being massively more intriguing than the big budget of this one  


i mean i can hold out hope and all, but like.. how can it even be saved at this point? all the characters have been made bland, there's not really all that much that can carry the last two episodes for me
Thank you Game of Thrones
This is probably a stupid question to ask this crowd, but.....

Is it worth watching? 

I've never seen even a minute of it, and scrolled past all the social media posts. I'm at a point now where I would have time to see it, even though it's apparently about to end. (Same about the Marvel movies, by the way.) I have no idea at all what it's about, except some medieval style story between feuding families, except with dragons?

Clearly I'm not in it for the social media. If I were to watch this, it would be for the story itself and not to "catch up" with anybody. So: Worth it?
Nah this season makes the whole show suck and not worth it - every Reddit game of thrones fan probably...

I for one am excited for the ending and can’t wait to see the prequels
Decided to tune into S8 to see what all you show watchers experience. Since i dont care i read the finale spoilers. Damn feel bad for you guys, d and d really ruined this show. It makes me sad you guys have to go through this mess of the last seasons (or so i have been told). Please consider reading the books and waiting for the next ones if you end up disappointed by the show after the finale.
For me personally 100% the ending is the most important no matter how good the show is, if they butcher the ending it falls lower in my rankings.
In the books there’s something, that might come into play next episode. I probably shouldn’t say what, don’t want to spoil anything, unless you guys want me to.
"On the last seven seasons of GAME. OF. THRONES!"
Game of Thrones: History and Lore
That was Tyrion
Gamers of Thrones
One of the most realistic outcomes of season 8
Do you guys really still have to put no spoilers on everything?  The show's over.
How's this not a spoiler?
Who is the guy supposed to be between Varys and the Night King?

Edit: it’s Cersei 
How is this a spoiler?
Who’s between Cersei and Varys?
I don’t like game of thrones 
how is this a spoiler?
Major spoiler!!!! They all gonna die...
Don't risk the spoilers!
That's because *spoiler they're all Bran 
Yeah, it's better to binge, but the spoilers everywhere aren't worth it.
That's interesting. Looks like they blacked out the person/thing chasing Arya in post to avoid spoilers. Must be somebody important.
Too much spoiler for me. 
Ha! Can you imagine of that was the ending??? Cersei remains on the throne but you find out its Arya at the end??
Game of thrones actually happened: confirmed 
Isn't this a spoiler? I think it's fine but by this subs standards the character aspects spoil parts of the series, do they not? 
It Game of Thrones so if this happens it makes sense
Game of throney throney thrones game of thrones
Thanks for seasons 1 to 7 game of thrones!
You say no spoilers but I only see one dragon
“No spoilers” right...
"No Spoilers" except there's only 1 dragon.
Which One is Tyrion?
Tyrion and the Boyz!
Tywin is in front with Tyrion and Varys.
The final season was awful, but I don't regret the time I spent with this show. And there are still the final books to come... maybe.
You came to the wrong place if you didn't want spoilers. (Also, that is not a spoiler.)
Ha I thought that was Daenerys the whole time
Still a better story than game of thrones
Prolly spoilers
Love how it says \[SPOILERS\] but you already know what the spoiler is going to be... the fact that she returns home. Shaking my head. 
This is a better ending then the show
Not sure what the point of the [No Spoilers] tag is lately.
Season 8 ruined it all
Don't forget, he took one character, and Dany is probably gonna become a villain over it.
Fam it's Game of Thrones... your parents are watching premiere night!!
